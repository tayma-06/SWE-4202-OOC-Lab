# Lab 1 - Assignment (13.05.25)

This lab consists of three tasks to help students get started with Java programming and understand object-oriented design through a real-world scenario.

---

## ✅ Task 1: Write and Run Your First Java Program

Begin your journey with Java by writing a simple program, compiling it, and running it successfully.

## ✅ Task 2: Object-Oriented Design – Hospital Appointment System

**Scenario:**  
You are tasked with designing a system for **Humanity Hospital**, located in Dhaka, Bangladesh, which is known for its volunteer services. The hospital has several departments such as Oncology, Surgery, and Medicine. Each department contains multiple doctors with different qualifications and specialties.

Each doctor:
- Has a scheduled duty to see patients
- Has two weekdays reserved for golfing

**Patients** can make an appointment with a doctor by providing:
- Name
- Age
- Gender
- Appointment date

The system should:
- Confirm the appointment if the doctor is available and has open slots on the given date

### Objective:  
As a software engineer, design a software system using **Object-Oriented Concepts** to support the scenario described above.

### Steps to Follow:
1. **Grammatical Parsing:** Identify nouns in the scenario and classify them.
2. **Class Identification:** Determine potential classes.
3. **Attribute Identification:** Identify relevant data for each class.
4. **Verb Parsing:** Extract meaningful actions.
5. **Method Identification:** Define appropriate behaviors (methods) for each class.
6. **Class Card Creation:** Create class summaries with attributes and methods.
7. **Class Relationships:** Define associations and multiplicity between classes.
8. **Verification:** Ensure each class has clear responsibilities.
